    <i>Lightweight</i>, platform independent MS-TDS implementation written in pure C++11 that can work with just <strong>2kB</strong> of SRAM!
<br />
</p>

----

Built around C++'s `zero cost / only pay for what you use` mantra. The implementation is based on Microsoft's `MS-TDS: Tabular Data Stream Protocol` technical specification (revision number 33).

## Installing the library

Import the `tdslite-<version>.zip` into your libraries. See [releases](https://github.com/mustafakemalgilor/tdslite/releases).

### ... via the Arduino IDE

`Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library...` and then select the downloaded `tdslite-<version>.zip` file.

## The goal

The main design goal of the project is to enable a wide variety of constrained devices (e.g. embedded, IoT) to talk to a TDS server (e.g. Microsoft SQL Server). The aim is not to implement the TDS standard down to every single letter. Most of the use cases do not require many legacy features that the TDS standard carries along, so the remaining feature set that TDS offer will be implemented on an `as-needed` basis, rather than being implemented upfront.

`tdslite` is:

- a lightweight, production-ready implementation that can work in embedded environments
- agnostic from any particular architecture, platform, environment or standard library implementation (*except for a few basic things).
- not embedded-centric, but embedded-suitable

## The design

`tdslite` is made from two main parts: the `tdslite` library, and the networking implementation. They're located at `tdslite` and `tdslite-net` folders respectively.

The main user-facing class of `tdslite` is the `tdslite::driver<T>` class, where the `T` is the networking implementation of choice. `tdslite` does not depend on any concrete networking implementation and can work with anything that satisfies the constraints defined in the [network_io_contract](src/tdslite-net/base/network_io_contract.hpp#L79) class.

The `tdslite-net` library provides two of such networking implementations; one of them is based on `Boost.ASIO` (tdslite-net-asio), and the other one being `Arduino EthernetClient` interface compatible one(tdslite-net-arduino). ASIO-based networking implementation is used for the integration tests and the [example `sql shell` application](examples/minimal-sql-shell/minimal.cpp). `tdslite-net-arduino` can work with anything that implements the `EthernetClient` interface (e.g. EthernetClient, WiFiClient):

```c++
    #include <Ethernet.h>
    #include <WiFi.h>
    #include <tdslite.h>

    tdsl::uint8_t net_buf[1024] = {};

    /* You can use the arduino_driver with EthernetClient: */
    tdsl::arduino_driver<EthernetClient> driver_e{net_buf};

    /* ... or with WiFiClient: ... */
    tdsl::arduino_driver<WiFiClient> driver_w{net_buf};

    /* ... or, even with your own, custom type that implements the EthernetClient interface: */
    struct my_client {
        int connect(const char * host, unsigned short port) ;
        bool connected();
        int available();
        void flush();
        void stop();
        tdsl::size_t write(const unsigned char * buf, tdsl::size_t len);
        int read(unsigned char * buf, unsigned long amount);
        tdsl::uint16_t localPort();
        tdsl::uint16_t remotePort();
        IPAddress localIP();
        IPAddress remoteIP();       
    };
    /* use your own custom type */
    tdsl::arduino_driver<my_client> driver_c{net_buf};
```

## Runtime dependencies

tdslite is a self-contained library with no external dependencies, and it does not rely on C++ standard library to function. Instead, needed functionality from C++ standard library is implemented from scratch as needed (e.g., type_traits, span). Therefore, the only requirement to use this library is **to have a decent, C++11 compliant compiler**.

----

## The tech stack

The below are the tools and libraries that used for developing this project:

- `CMake`: build system generator for the project
- `Docker`: The development environment containers
- `googletest`: unit and integration tests
- `Conan`: used as dependency manager, fetches dependencies for tests (e.g. Boost, googletest)
- `Boost`: Used for the ASIO-based `test` network implementation
- `clang-format`: Code formatting
- `pio`: Platform.IO CLI, used for HW CI tests

----

## Testing

Tests are under the [tests](tests/) folder. The tests are primarily separated to four categories:

- [unit](tests/unit/) Unit tests.
- [integration](tests/integration/) tdslite - MSSQL integration tests. These tests use the internal MSSQL server.
- [cxxcompat](tests/cxxcompat/) All unit tests and integrations tests curated and compiled with C++11/14/17/20 modes.
- [sketches](tests/sketches/) Verification sketches for real hardware tests

### The release process

There are a few simple criterias before releasing the new version of the `tdslite`.

- All unit, integration and cxxcompat tests must be green.
- The CI pipeline must be green.
- The sketches* must run stable for at least 3 days straight in the device farm**, with
  - No freezes
  - No restarts
  - No memory leaks

### Sketches

[sketches](tests/sketches/) that are intended for real hardware testing. These sketches are used for performing stability testing before the releases. The sketches and the used hardware list is as follows.

- [Arduino sketch](tests/sketches/arduino/arduino.cpp):
  - Arduino Mega
  - Arduino Nano
  - Arduino Uno
- [ESP sketch](tests/sketches/esp/esp.cpp)
  - NodeMCU-32 (ESP32S)
  - NodeMCU V3 (ESP8266MOD)

We're intending to make this grow larger with more hardware and different kinds of tests. You can donate real hardware or a few bucks in order to make this list grow bigger.

## Contributing

See [the contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions on how to get started with our project.

We accept different types of contributions, including some that don't require you to write a single line of code.

## Q&A

Q: My ethernet library is not supported. What can I do?

A: Most of the mainstram third-party ethernet libraries are compatible with EthernetClient interface. For the ethernet libraries that are not compatible with EthernetClient interface you may:

- a) roll your own wrapper class
- b) suggest third-party library author to implement a compatible interface
- c) suggest tdslite inclusion

The option `c` may be feasible if it's a widely adopted Ethernet library.
